        <h2>THE WORLD DRIVERS'CHAMPIONSHIP</h2>
        <p>
            The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one 
            of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950. The word "formula" in 
            the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.[1] A Formula One season 
            consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (French for ''grand prizes' or 'great prizes''),
            which take place worldwide on purpose-built circuits and on public roads.

        <h2>THE WINNERS</h2>
        <p>The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers,
        the other for constructors. Drivers must hold valid Super Licences, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA.[2] The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.
        Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks, but several events take place on city streets.</p>

        <h2>THE CARS</h2>
        <p>Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high 
        cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. 
        The cars underwent major changes in 2017,[3] allowing wider front and rear wings, and wider tyres, 
        resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of up to approximately 370 km/h (230 mph).</p>
